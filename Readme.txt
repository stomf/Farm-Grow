Farm and Grow

Hi Everyone!

Farm and Grow was written for a Kongregate Game Jam. You can view the forum discussion here:
http://www.kongregate.com/forums/4-game-programming/topics/282171-gitd-26-entries-and-discussion

I wrote the game in 4 days. When it was finished, it turned out to be popular, so I spent a bit more time polishing it, fixing bugs and adding the save game feature. There's about 3 weeks work in this, total.

I've had more people ask for this source code than any other game I've written. I usually give away source to people who ask nicely, but this game was a little different:

* It was a partial commercial success, making about $300
* Andkon kindly bought a site lock licence, and I didn't want to devalue that purchase
* This is hacky, nasty, fast game jam code. It is not a good source to learn from.
* Some of the requests looked really dodgy. Like someone from China couldn't break my site lock and thought he'd try asking for the source instead. Doesn't matter any more, this game is earning less than $1 a week.

On the other hand, I have used lots of open source assets and I want to give something back now. I've waited a year, so I think Andkon got their money's worth.

Licence Stuff
-------------
The items in the assets folder fall under CC BY-SA 3.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) and the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)

My code is issued under the same licence with the additional appendum: If you release the compiled game to the public, it must be significantly changed/improved before you do so. This is because I do not want anyone to confuse my work with yours.
You must also link to http://www.kongregate.com/games/CuriousGaming/farm-and-grow.

The music for the original game can be found here: http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/307134 
I have permission from the author to use but not redistribute the music. You will need to find your own.

Getting the code to work
------------------------
You need a copy of Flash CS5 or later. The trial can be downloaded for free from Adobe's website. I also used FlashDevelop for editing the code - that's what the as3proj file is for. But if you're happy with Adobe's code highlighting and auto-complete then use the code editor in Flash instead.

I replaced the music file with a placeholder mp3. 

Known bug - the save game code can fail if the game has been running for a long time. This will cause the game to freeze and the save will be broken. I think it's something to do with the animals in the pastures. The save feature was added afterwards and it's even hackier than the rest of the code. If you can fix it, I'll owe you a beer.

Expanding the game
------------------
Beware the temptation to add more fields. The point of the game is to achieve self-sufficiency. When it becomes obvious that you can feed you family, afford to educate them and build what you want, you've won. There's some satisfaction watching your family flourish after that tipping point, but the challenge is gone. Adding more fields makes the game less interesting. If you want to make the game longer/bigger, more content and challenges are required.

Stuff I would add if was going to spend more time on this game (aka suggested improvements)
-Children growing up.
-Genders.
-Animating the meeples when they perform tasks.
-Sound effects.
-A family tree.
-Better town interface. Alternatively, bring the town to the player by letting them build schools/markets etc.
-A tutorial
